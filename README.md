# AnimeListinAnotherWorld
This project is a web application that allows users to create and manage their anime watchlists. 

Users can register and log in to access their personalized anime lists. 
They can add, update, and delete anime entries, specifying their watch status (watching, completed, plan to watch). 
The application leverages the Jikan API to fetch anime details and images. 
Technologies used include Java with Spring Boot for the backend, Thymeleaf for the frontend, and MySQL for database storage.
